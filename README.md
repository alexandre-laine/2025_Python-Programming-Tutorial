# 2025_Python-Programming-Tutorial
 
Welcome on this repository created to host the 2025 Python tutoring sessions for Neuroscience Masterâ€™s students.

The aim of this 2025 edition is a bit different from the previous. We will, along all sessions help you learn how to code by trial and error and provide you a dedicated time every week to be tutored on a project of your choice. We will go through the basic if needed, and support you on your coding learning journey. Bonus, if by the end we can improve your understanding of computational neuroscience and your enemy to lovers coding relationship.

All the shared documents and datasets will be accesible in this repo. And if some of you are interested in the basic of programming and python: here is the link to the last year tutoring program:  https://github.com/Cypriendtr/2024_Master_Neuro_Python_tutorat.
